Welcome to ``yeadon``'s documentation!
==================================

This package calculates the masses, center of mass positions, and inertia
tensors that correspond to the human inertia model developed by Yeadon
in (Yeadon, 1990). The package allows for the input of both measurements from
human subjects and configuration variables (joint angles) with which one can
orient the model. Additionally, the package allows for 3D visualization of the
model using the MayaVi package.

The following is the contents of this documentation:

The README.txt contains installation instructions.

This package was developed during the Summer of 2011 at the University of
California, Davis, to aid with the bicycle research of Jason Moore and Dale
Luke Peterson in the Sports Biomechanics Lab of Professor Mont Hubbard. Learn
